                        <p><b>Pashupatinath Temple</b> - One of the holiest Hindu shrines in Nepal, the Pashupatinath Temple is stretched across both the banks of the beautiful and sacred Bagmati River on the eastern fringes of the capital city of Kathmandu. The magnificent sanctum devoted to Lord Shiva draws in thousands of devotees who come to offer their prayers and seek blessings from him. Sprawled over a large area with temples and ashrams, it is believed that the Jyotirlinga housed in the Pashupatinath temple is the head of the body which is made up of the twelve Jyotirlinga in India. In 1979, the magnificent temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
                        <p><b>Boudhanath Stupa</b> - Situated at about 11 kilometers from the city centre of Kathmandu, Boudhanath Stupa dominates the Kathmandu skyline with its gargantuan spherical shape. Thousands of pilgrims from different religions gather here daily. They perform a ritualistic circumnavigation, known as the 'kora', of the colossal dome. It is believed that anyone who circumambulates the stupa with no ill thoughts in their hearts receives good karma. Moreover, the gates of hell are permanently closed for them!</p>
                        <p><b>Kathmandu Darbar Square</b> - The place which has witnessed and received one king after the other as they sat and ruled over Nepal a long time ago, where new rulers were crowned while the steady beats of drums and trumpets filled the place. The regal Kathmandu Durbar Square is one of the three durbar squares in the country. Till date, the place remains the most remarkable legacy of Kathmandu's traditional architecture. Even though the unfortunate earthquake of 2015 took its toll on the building and around half a dozen places within the premises collapsed, it has still retained its original glory. Three squares - A former elephant stable Basantapur square, main Durbar square on the west and another part of Durbar Square that houses the entrance to Hanuman Dhoka which are loosely connected make up the Durbar Square area.</p>
                        <p><b>Swayambhu Temple</b> - Perched on top of the Semgu Hill located in the outskirts to the west of the Kathmandu Valley, Swayambhu Temple temple is one of the most important religious shrines in the city of Kathmandu. With a white dome stupa and an array of shrines, this place draws people to it daily. Circumnavigating the temple in a clockwise direction is a common practice among the pilgrims since it is believed to wash away all the sins. The sanctum is one of the holiest sites among the Buddhists and Tibetans and is second only to the Lord Boudha for them.</p>
